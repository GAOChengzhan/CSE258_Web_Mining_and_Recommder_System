Problem1 Would Read Prediction
I used two thresholds to predict whether the user would read this book or not. The one is the popularity of the book.
 The other is the maximum similarity between this book and the other books that the user has read before. When 
reading one line,  whether the popularity of the book surpasses the popularity threshold OR the maximum similarity 
surpasses the similarity threshold can result in the prediction of 'Would Read'. After a large number of experiments, 
the popularity threshold is set to the top 72 percent of the most popular books in the training data while the similarity 
is set to the top 1 percent value of maximum similarity.

Problem2 Rating Prediction
I've tried several models. Finally, I picked this model Latent Factor Model (with bias only) which performs best on the 
test set. The optimization progress of this model is simple, the only hyper-parameter is the lambda. I run this model 
on different lambda ranging from 10 to 1e-5, and find it performs best when lambda is 4.
