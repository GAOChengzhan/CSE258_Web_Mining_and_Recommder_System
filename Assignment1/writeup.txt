Problem1 Would Read Prediction
I used two thresholds to predict whether the user would read this book or not. The one is popularity of the book and the other is the maximum similarity 
between this book and the other books that the user has read before. When reading one line,  whether the popularity of the book surpasses the popularity
threshold OR the maximum similarity surpass the similarity threshold can result in the predict of 'Would Read'. After a large amount of experiments, the 
popularity threshold is set to the  top 72 percent popular books in the taining data while the similarity is set to the top 1 percent maximum similarity.
